    <p>
        This is an example of an API to upload/download data based on a user login.<br>
        The API was developed on the XAMMP stack, so MySQL for the db and Apache as the webserver.<br>
        The UI is extremely basic because this is an API showcase.<br><br>
        To get started load the db in docs/phpfileapi.sql, create an account and login. Then you can upload/download files<br>
        (IMPORTANT) Keep the console open for debugging at all times
